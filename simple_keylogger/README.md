## Some explanation
A keylogger (keylogger) is a small program whose main purpose is to covertly monitor keystrokes on the keyboard and keep a log of these keystrokes.  
### Hardware keylogger 
Cons:  
* No way to install remotely
* Memory limitation
* To receive the report, physical access to the computer is required (if the model is without a Wi-Fi module)
* Can only be used in cases where the victim does not understand the computer hardware  
  
Pros:  
* Keylogger that anti-virus and anti-spyware software cannot see
* Not high price compared to acoustic keyloggers (but software keyloggers are cheaper)
* Reporting over built-in Wi-Fi (not available on all models) 
### Acoustic Keylogger 
Cons:  
* High price
* The purchase of this equipment is illegal
* Big size
* There are errors in the recognition accuracy of the acoustic cryptanalysis system
* Not available for sale  
  
Pros:  
* Keylogger that software antiviruses and anti-spyware do not see
* Works from a distance
* No physical access to the computer required 
### Software keylogger 
Cons:  
* Some keyloggers are entered in the signature database of antivirus software and are identified by them as malware, which is why they can be deleted in the process.  
  
Pros:  
* Price
* Big choice
* Technical support for developers
* To install a keylogger and receive reports, you do not need physical access to a computer
